# NAME
**cistern** â€“ Continuous Integration Table Of Pipelines

# SYNOPSIS
`cistern [-r REPOSITORY | --repository REPOSITORY] [COMMIT]`

`cistern -h | --help`

`cistern --version`

# DESCRIPTION
cistern monitors the CI pipelines associated to a specific commit of a git repository.

cistern currently integrates with the following online services. Each of the service is one or both
of the following:

* A "source provider" that is used to list the pipelines associated to a given commit of an online repository
* A "CI provider" that is used to get detailed information about CI builds

--------------------------------------------------------
Service        Source   CI      URL
-------------  -------  ------  ---------------------------
GitHub         yes      no      [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)

GitLab         yes      yes     [https://gitlab.com/](https://gitlab.com/)

AppVeyor       no       yes     [https://www.appveyor.com/](https://www.appveyor.com/)

CircleCI       no       yes     [https://circleci.com/](https://circleci.com/)

Travis CI      no       yes     [https://travis-ci.org/](https://travis-ci.org/)
                                [https://travis-ci.com/](https://travis-ci.com/)
                             
Azure Devops   no       yes     [https://dev.azure.com](https://dev.azure.com)

--------------------------------------------------------

# POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
## `COMMIT`
Specify the commit to monitor. COMMIT is expected to be the SHA identifier of a commit, or the
name of a tag or a branch. If this option is missing cistern will monitor the commit referenced by
HEAD.

Example:
```shell
# Show pipelines for commit 64be3c6
cistern 64be3c6
# Show pipelines for the commit referenced by the tag '0.9.0'
cistern 0.9.0
# Show pipelines for the commit at the tip of a branch
cistern feature/doc
```

# OPTIONS
## `-r=REPOSITORY, --repository=REPOSITORY`
Specify the git repository to monitor. If REPOSITORY is the path of a local repository, cistern
will monitor all the associated remotes. If REPOSITORY is a URL, cistern will monitor the
corresponding online repository. 

If this option is not set, cistern will behave as if it had been set to the path of the current
directory.

Note that cistern will only monitor repositories hosted on GitLab or GitHub.

Examples:
```shell
# Monitor pipelines of the git repository in the current directory
cistern
# Monitor pipelines of the repository specified by a web URL
cistern -r https://gitlab.com/nbedos/cistern
cistern -r github.com/nbedos/cistern
# Git URLs are accepted
cistern -r git@github.com:nbedos/cistern.git
# A path referring to a local repository is valid too
cistern -r /home/user/repos/myrepo
```

## `-h, --help`
Show usage of cistern

## `--version`
Print the version of cistern being run

# CONFIGURATION FILE
## Location
cistern follows the XDG base directory specification \[2\] and expects to find the configuration file
at one of the following locations depending on the value of the two environment variables
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `XDG_CONFIG_DIRS`:

1. `"$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cistern/cistern.toml"`
2. `"$DIR/cistern/cistern.toml"` for every directory `DIR` in the comma-separated list `"$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS"`

If `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (resp. `XDG_CONFIG_DIRS`) is not set, cistern uses the default value
`"$HOME/.config"` (resp. `"/etc/xdg"`) instead.


## Format
cistern uses a configuration file in [TOML version v0.5.0](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/blob/master/versions/en/toml-v0.5.0.md)
format. The configuration file is made of keys grouped together in tables. The specification of
each table is given in the example below.

## Example
This example describes and uses all existing configuration options.

```toml
#### CISTERN CONFIGURATION FILE ####
# This file is a complete, valid configuration file for cistern
# and should be located at $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cistern/cistern.toml
# 

## PROVIDERS ##
[providers]
# The 'providers' table is used to define credentials for 
# accessing online services. cistern relies on two types of
# providers:
#
#    - 'source providers' are used for listing the CI pipelines
#    associated to a given commit (GitHub and GitLab are source
#    providers)
#    - 'CI providers' are used to get detailed information about
#    CI pipelines (GitLab, AppVeyor, CircleCI, Travis and Azure
#    Devops are CI providers)
#
# cistern requires credentials for at least one source provider and
# one CI provider to run. Feel free to remove sections below 
# as long as this rule is met.
#
# Note that for all providers, not setting an API token or 
# setting `token = ""` will cause the provider to make
# unauthenticated API requests. 
#

### GITHUB ###
[[providers.github]]
# GitHub API token (optional, string)
#
# Note: Unauthenticated API requests are heavily rate-limited by 
# GitHub (60 requests per hour and per IP address) whereas 
# authenticated clients benefit from a rate of 5000 requests per
# hour. Providing an  API token is strongly encouraged: without
# one, cistern will likely reach the rate limit in a matter of
# minutes.
#
# GitHub token management: https://github.com/settings/tokens
token = ""


### GITLAB ###
[[providers.gitlab]]
# Name shown by cistern for this provider
# (optional, string, default: "gitlab")
name = "gitlab"

# GitLab instance URL (optional, string, default: "https://gitlab.com")
# (the GitLab instance must support GitLab REST API V4)
url = "https://gitlab.com"

# GitLab API token (optional, string)
#
# Note: GitLab prevents access to pipeline jobs for 
# unauthenticated users meaning if you wish to use cistern
# to view GitLab pipelines you will have to provide
# appropriate credentials. This is true even for pipelines
# of public repositories.
#
# gitlab.com token management:
#     https://gitlab.com/profile/personal_access_tokens
token = ""


### TRAVIS CI ###
[[providers.travis]]
# Name shown by cistern for this provider
# (optional, string, default: "travis")
name = "travis"

# URL of the Travis instance. "org" and "com" can be used as
# shorthands for the full URL of travis.org and travis.com
# (string, mandatory)
url = "org"

# API access token for the travis API (string, optional)
# Travis tokens are managed at:
#    - https://travis-ci.org/account/preferences
#    - https://travis-ci.com/account/preferences
token = ""


# Define another account for accessing travis.com
[[providers.travis]]
name = "travis"
url = "com"
token = ""


### APPVEYOR ###
[[providers.appveyor]]
# Name shown by cistern for this provider
# (optional, string, default: "appveyor")
name = "appveyor"

# AppVeyor API token (optional, string)
# AppVeyor token managemement: https://ci.appveyor.com/api-keys
token = ""


### CIRCLECI ###
[[providers.circleci]]
# Name shown by cistern for this provider
# (optional, string, default: "circleci")
name = "circleci"

# Circle CI API token (optional, string)
# See https://circleci.com/account/api
token = ""


### AZURE DEVOPS ###
[[providers.azure]]
# Name shown by cistern for this provider
# (optional, string, default: "azure")
name = "azure"

# Azure API token (optional, string)
# Azure token management is done at https://dev.azure.com/ via
# the user settings menu
token = ""

```

# ENVIRONMENT
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

* `BROWSER` is used to find the path of the default web browser
* `PAGER` is used to view log files. If the variable is not set, cistern will call `less`
* `HOME`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` are used to locate the configuration file

## LOCAL PROGRAMS

cistern relies on the following local executables:

* `less` to view log files, unless `PAGER` is set
* `man` to show the manual page
* `git` (optional) to translate the abbreviated SHA identifier of a commit into
a non-abbreviated SHA and also to support 'insteadOf' and 'pushInsteadOf'
configuration options for remote URLs

# EXAMPLES

Monitor pipelines of the current git repository
```shell
# Move to a directory containing a git repository of your choosing
git clone git@github.com:nbedos/cistern.git && cd cistern
# Run cistern to list the pipelines associated to the last commit of the repository 
cistern

# Show pipelines associated to a specific commit, tag or branch
cistern a24840c
cistern 0.1.0
cistern master
```

Monitor pipelines of other repositories
```shell
# Show pipelines of a repository identified by a URL or path
cistern -r https://gitlab.com/nbedos/cistern        # Web URL
cistern -r git@github.com:nbedos/cistern.git        # Git URL
cistern -r github.com/nbedos/cistern                # URL without scheme
cistern -r /home/user/repos/repo                  # Path to a repository

# Specify both repository and git reference
cistern -r github.com/nbedos/cistern master
```
